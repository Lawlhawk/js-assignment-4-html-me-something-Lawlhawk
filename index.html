         <p >Video games have always held a special place in my heart. Ever since I received a GameBoy for my 5th birthday, I've been completely infatuated with them.   In fact, it'd be fairly accurate to say that I've been playing games for more than 2/3rds of my life. Out of the thousands (Yes, you read that correctly) of games I've played over the years, there are a select few that I always find myself coming back to. Here's a condensed list of what I would consider to by my top 5 so far.  </p>

               <h2>Chibi-Robo</h2>

               </figure>
               <p>Chibi-Robo is a platforming game where the plot is that you're a tiny robot butler solving issues for a household by cleaning and completing puzzles. Now I know what you're thinking: "<i>If I don't like to clean in real life, what makes you think I want to play a game about it??</i>" But trust me, there's something about watching the little robot scrub a stain off a carpet that's just so... serene. The simple, yet captivating gameplay makes it something that even someone who doesn't play games on a regular basis could pick up and enjoy. That, plus its very calming and somber soundtrack will have you cleaning in the game for hours just to hear the song that accompanies it.</p>

               <h2>Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</h2>

               </figure>
               <p>Eternal Darkness is a psychological horror action-adventure game where you take on the roles of several characters as they traverse throughout their journeys against a powerful entity who seeks to enslave humanity. The thing that makes this game different from others in the survival horror series was the introduction of a 'Sanity Meter', which would raise and lower based on your characters current stress levels. So in addition to the typical monsters and jumpscares, you also had to worry about your character becoming too stressed out and <b>HALLUCINATING</b>. Such effects included: exploding upon entering a room, disconnecting your controller, and the ever-loathesome false message about having your game crash and your memory card corrupted (real tears were shed that day).   </p>

               <h2>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>

               </figure>
               <p>Yep. You probably saw this one coming. Skyrim is an open world role playing game with an absolute TON of things to do, making it great for just goofing off or replaying. Fair warning, this game is the definitive example of a timesink: one 5 minute fetch quest can easily turn into hours of exploration and dungeon raiding. In addition to the base version of the game, there is also a very active modding community that periodically adds more improvements to this game, making each playthrough vastly different from the next. Oddly enough, the game has be re-released with DLC and upgraded visuals about 4 or 5 times now (and for my own dignity, I will not disclose how many versions and times I've paid for this game)</p>

               <h2>Harvest Moon 64</h2>
               <figure class="image">
                  <img src="C:\Users\eq2he\js-assignment-4-html-me-something-Lawlhawk\images\Harvest_Moon_64_Coverart.png" alt="'Harvest Moon 64 cover art">
                  <figcaption>There's something about working all day on a digital farm...</figcaption>

               </figure>
               <p>So if you're a fan of titles like <i>Stardew Valley, Rune Factory, or Animal Crossing</i>, I would definitely recommend Harvest Moon 64. While yes, there are more modern titles in the series, this one still holds the same magic as it did when it intially released. You assume the role of the protagonist character, who just inherited a farm from their recently deceased grandfather. The game then gives you full control, allowing you to turn the farm into whatever you'd like to produce, whether it be seasonal vegetables, a lumber mill, or even livestock. It's a peaceful little game to sit down and zone out for a few hours at a time with.  </p>

               <h2>No Man's Sky</h2>
               <figure class="image">
                  <img src="C:\Users\eq2he\js-assignment-4-html-me-something-Lawlhawk\images\NoMansSky.avif" alt="No Man's Sky cover art">
                  <figcaption>Space... the final frontier or something like that</figcaption>
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDkxSemC2zg&ab_channel=UnikPlays">No Man's Sky Gameplay on YouTube</a>
               </figure>
               <p>No Man's Sky is another open world sandbox game -- but calling it open world doesn't really do it justice. It's more like <i>open galaxy</i>, as each planet that you can explore and visit is procedurally generated; so far touting a number of ~1,000,000+ within its registries. There's tons of things to get into in the game, from space battle and exploration, learning solar system economies and engaging in trade, or builing your own base of operations and harvesting elements from the planets. This also includes <i>underwater</i> bases and compounds as well, definitely another game you can spend several hours playing without noticing the time pass </p>
